<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Make your own chewy energy/granola bars with a not-too-sweet chocolate flavor with hints of coconut and almond.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups rolled oats</li>
    <li>1 cup puffed brown rice cereal</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped raw almonds</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded coconut</li>
    <li>3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>tiny pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup maple syrup</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 pan with butter and line with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Combine rolled oats, puffed brown rice cereal, almonds, coconut, cocoa powder, salt, and cayenne in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, and water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir, and let the mixture boil for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Pour sugar mixture over the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix thoroughly. Transfer to the prepared pan, and smooth out the top, pressing lightly with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. While still hot, use a spatula to score the pan into 8 portions. Let cool to room temperature before breaking into bars. You can also not score, and simply let cool, then cut with a knife.</li>
